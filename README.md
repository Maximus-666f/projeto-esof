# Bin Finder Development Report

Welcome to the documentation pages of the _Bin Finder_!

You can find here details about the _Bin Finder_, from a high-level vision to low-level implementation decisions, a kind of Software Development Report, organized by type of activities: 

- [Bin Finder Development Report](#bin-finder-development-report)
  - [Business Modelling](#business-modelling)
    - [Product Vision](#product-vision)
    - [Features and Assumptions](#features-and-assumptions)
    - [Elevator Pitch](#elevator-pitch)
  - [Requirements](#requirements)
    - [Domain model](#domain-model)
  - [Architecture and Design](#architecture-and-design)
    - [Logical architecture](#logical-architecture)
    - [Physical architecture](#physical-architecture)
    - [Vertical prototype](#vertical-prototype)

Contributions are expected to be made exclusively by the initial team, but we may open them to the community, after the course, in all areas and topics: requirements, technologies, development, experimentation, testing, etc.

Please contact us!

Thank you!

## Business Modelling

### Product Vision

This app will allow the user to access a map with the distribution of trash and recycling bins around the world and be part of a community that brings our app to life by adding new bins and correcting the mistakes of others with reports. Allowing for our app to be self-suficient and fully community driven.

### Features and Assumptions

1. Account creation and management system
2. Visualization of a map with the bins and the ability to filter by specific type of bin
3. Ability to add new bin in the map and specify it's type
4. Voting system for each specific bin, both positive votes and reports in order to correct badly indicated bins
5. The ability to get the directions to a specific bin
6. A search bar showcasing nearby bins has an alternative way of searching for them, including being able to filter by specific bin type
7. A score system, that gives the user points for their contributions.

### Elevator Pitch

[TODO]

## Requirements

### Domain model

To better understand the context of the software system, it is very useful to have a simple UML class diagram with all the key concepts (names, attributes) and relationships involved of the problem domain addressed by your module. 
Also provide a short textual description of each concept (domain class).
